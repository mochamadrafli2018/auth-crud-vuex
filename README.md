## Note

- This repository was originally cloned from https://github.com/cornflourblue/vue-vuex-registration-login-example.git and updated several files.

- The structure of the files in the original repository was too complex (in my prespective as a newbie) and this repository was simplified of the original repository but with the same code to make simple.

- The originial repository was used old package of React, React Dom and React Router Dom. So, in this repo those packages was updated to React/React Dom v.17 and React Router Dom v.6.
